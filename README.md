##Online Interview Problem Solving Workshop
###June through August 2020


Spend about 10 hours per week this summer practicing your problem solving skills and preparing for coding interviews for summer 2021 internships. Upon successful completion of the workshop you will be ready to tackle coding challenges from tech companies, which are often the first screening step in the interview process.

The workshop will have 4 primary components.:
Online modules that will help you improve and practice the kind of problem solving that is expected in most first-round coding interviews.
A weekly online session conducted on Zoom with live instruction and support. You are required to attend one session each week.
You select which session: Tuesdays 6-8pm OR Saturdays 1-3pm
Sessions start June 2, 2020 and end August 22, 2020
Weekly online support activities offered via Zoom. These will come in the form of office hours, group work sessions, and/or check-in sessions with a mentor (we are still working out the details). You will have an opportunity to select which sessions you attend based on your availability; however, you will be required to participate in at least 1 hour of additional support per week.
A required short weekly reflection form that will help you evaluate your progress and help us better understand how we can support you.

The modules can be completed at your own pace, however, to be eligible for the coding challenges with industry partners you need to complete certain modules by certain dates. These dates will be communicated to you throughout the workshop.

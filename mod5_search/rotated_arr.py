"""
Suppose a sorted array A is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
Find the minimum element.
The array will not contain duplicates.

Note: If you know the number of times the array is rotated, then this problem becomes trivial. If the number of rotation is x, then minimum element is A[x].

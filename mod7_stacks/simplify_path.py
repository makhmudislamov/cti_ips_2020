"""
Given an absolute path for a file (Unix-style), simplify it. Or in other words, convert it to the canonical path.
In a UNIX-style file system, a period . refers to the current directory. Furthermore, a double period .. moves the directory up a level. For more information, see: Absolute path vs relative path in Linux/Unix
Note that the returned canonical path must always begin with a slash /, and there must be only a single slash / between two directory names. The last directory name (if it exists) must not end with a trailing /. Also, the canonical path must be the shortest string representing the absolute path.

Example 1:
Input: "/home/"
Output: "/home"
Explanation: Note that there is no trailing slash after the last directory name.

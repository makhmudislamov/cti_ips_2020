"""
Given a long text string, count the number of occurrences of each word. Ignore case. Assume the boundary of a word is whitespace - a " ", or a line break denoted by "\n". Ignore all punctuation, such as . , ~ ? !. Assume hyphens are part of a word - "two-year-old" and "two year old" are one word, and three different words, respectively. 

Return the word counts as a string formatted with line breaks, in no particular order.

Example:
"I do not like green eggs and ham,
I do not like them, Sam-I-Am"

Output:
i 2
do 2
not 2
like 2
green 1
eggs 1
and 1
ham 1
them 1
sam-i-am 1

Also Valid:
and 1
do 2
eggs 1
green 1
ham 1
i 2
like 2
not 2
sam-i-am 1
them 1

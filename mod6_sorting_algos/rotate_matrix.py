"""
Given an NxN matrix, rotate it by 90 degrees. You should perform this operation in-place, using only constant memory.

Example:
starting matrix:
[
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
once rotated by 90 degrees, the matrix becomes:
 [
  [7, 4, 1]
  [8, 5, 2]
  [9, 6, 3]
]

Hint:
Is there an easy way to rotate a coordinate pair by 90 degrees?

"""
Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.
Find that element which does not appear thrice.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.
Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example:
>> arr = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>> single_number(arr) # returns 4

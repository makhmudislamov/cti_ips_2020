"""
Reverse polish notation is a postfix notation for mathematical expressions. For example, the infix expression (1 + 2) / 3 would become 1 2 + 3 /. More detailed explanation here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation

Task:
Given a mathematical expression in reverse polish notation, represented by an array of strings, find the answer to this expression. Operators consist only of +, -, *, /, and all numbers are integer values. When performing a division on two numbers, use python's integer division operator (//). Your output should be a single integer, which is the value of the expression when evaluated. Each expression is guaranteed to be valid.

Example 1:
expression = ["3", "4", "+", "5", "-"]
print(evaluate_expression(expression))
>> 2

Example 2:
expression = ["3", "4", "/", "5", "*"]
print(evaluate_expression(expression))
>> 0

Explanation 1:
"3 4 + 5 -" is equivalent to the infix expression "3 + 4 - 5"
The answer to this expression is 2.

Explanation 2:
"3 4 / 5 *" is equivalent to the infix expression "3 / 4 * 5"
Since we are using integer division, 3 / 4 = 0, and 0 * 5 = 0.
The answer to this expression is 0.
